# Intermediate Machine Learning Course: Housing Price Prediction

This Kaggle course([Link](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)) focuses on intermediate-level machine learning skills and applies them to predict housing prices using the dataset from the Housing Prices competition.


Through these exercises, I learned 5 different topics that accelerate my machine learning expertise. 
- tackle data types often found in real-world datasets([missing values](https://github.com/soyoungchoe/HousingPricesIntermediateML/blob/main/Intermediate%202%20Missing%20Value%20Housing.ipynb)), [categorical variables](https://github.com/soyoungchoe/HousingPricesIntermediateML/blob/main/Intermediate%203%20Categorical%20Variables%20Housing.ipynb))
- design [pipelines](https://github.com/soyoungchoe/HousingPricesIntermediateML/blob/main/Intermediate%204%20Pipeline%20Housing.ipynb) to improve the quality of my machine learning code
- use advanced techniques for model validation ([cross-validation](https://github.com/soyoungchoe/HousingPricesIntermediateML/blob/main/Intermediate%205%20Corss-Validation%20Housing.ipynb))
- build state-of-the-art models that are widely used to win Kaggle competitions ([XGBoost](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/xgboost))
- avoid common and important data science mistakes ([leakage](https://github.com/soyoungchoe/HousingPricesIntermediateML/blob/main/Intermediate%206%20XGBoost%20Housing.ipynb))


During this course, I was able to apply my knowledge by completing a hands-on exercise with real-world data for each new topic. The hand-on exercise use data, which has 79 different explanatory variables to predict home prices.
